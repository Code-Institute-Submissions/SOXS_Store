                        Regrettably it is difficult to change your order or the shipping address once it has been placed. We aim to ship all orders as fast as possible so our warehouse is processing them within 15 minutes of receiving them. If a change is necessary please contact
                        us and we will do our best to help you.

                        You can find the estimated delivery time for your order in your shipping confirmation email. Please note that it is calculated in business days (Mon-Fri). Since all orders are shipped by standard mail, the exact delivery time depends on your local postal
                        service.<br><br> Please allow for the estimated delivery time plus a few extra business days (Mon-Fri) to pass. If your order does not arrive within the estimated time, it is most likely just a bit delayed but will
                        still arrive within the next couple of days.<br><br> If your estimated delivery date has passed by more than five business days and you havenâ€™t received your order, please contact us so we can help you further. <br><br> Please note
                        that during final sales and the holiday season (November/December) delivery times can be longer than usual.
